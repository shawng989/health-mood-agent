The Health &amp; Mood Tracking Agent is designed to make daily wellness tracking effortless. Users can quickly log their mood, sleep, notes, or triggers, while an intelligent agent analyzes trends, detects patterns, and provides helpful suggestions to improve mental and physical well-being.  This project uses an agent-based architecture.
